== Description ==

This plugin shows on the Dashboard the Technorati Reactions of your blog. With the Wordpress new version (2.5) we have the possibility to add differents feeds to the dashboard, with this plugin you will show the technorati reactions without changing the Google Blog Incoming Links. This plugin will add the reactions to your Dashboard, because I think that Technoratiâ€™s reactions are good info too.
